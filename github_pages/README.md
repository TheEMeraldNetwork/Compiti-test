# Automated Math Solver

**⚠️ FOR TESTING PURPOSES ONLY ⚠️**

Welcome to the Automated Math Solver! This system automatically processes mathematical problems and provides step-by-step solutions.

## 🚀 How It Works

1. **Upload** mathematical problems to the `problems/` folder
2. **Wait** for automatic processing (every 30 minutes)
3. **Receive** solutions in the `solutions/` folder
4. **Get notified** via email when solutions are ready

## 📤 How to Submit Problems

### Step 1: Upload Files
- Navigate to the `problems/` folder in this repository
- Click "Add file" → "Upload files"

- **Images** (JPG, PNG) with handwritten or printed math problems
- **Text files** (.txt, .md) with mathematical questions

### Step 3: Example Problems
Create a text file with problems like:
```
Solve x^2 + 5x + 6 = 0
Find the derivative of f(x) = x^3 + 2x^2 - 5x + 1
Calculate the integral of sin(x) from 0 to π
What is the area of a circle with radius 7 meters?
Simplify: (x+2)(x-3)
```
